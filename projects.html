										Virtual Zoo Report</h1>
									<p>
									</p>
										
										  

										<P></P><h3>Task 1 Animal Class</h3>
									
										<p>
										<text-align: left>1.I would like to mention that I unintentionally omitted the initialization of instance variables
											(hunger, thirst and boredom) to 50. However, upon executing the program, I promptly
											recognized this oversight and promptly addressed it by adding the necessary initialization.
											Other than this, the program ran smoothly without any issues.</text-align: left> </p>
									
										<p>
										2. No, I encountered no difficulties when downloading and executing the provided initial code
										within IntelliJ.</p>
								
										<p>3. Nothing to fix in the IntelliJ to compile and run the code. While creating a new project, I
										selected Java version 17 and created it. Then the given codes have been executed successfully.</p>

										<p>4. The first line of the provided toString() method dynamically constructs a concise status
										message for the animal based on whether it is alive or dead. Using a ternary conditional
										operator, it checks the result of the isDead() method, which evaluates the animal&#39;s well-being
										by considering factors like hunger, thirst, and boredom. If the animal is alive, the message
										includes its name; if dead, it appends &quot; (Dead)&quot; to indicate its deceased state along with the
										name. This single line efficiently captures and communicates the essential information about
										the animal&#39;s condition.</p>
									
								</p>
										<p></p><h3>Task 2 Animal Selection</h3>
										<P></P>1. In the askNumberAnimals() method of the VirtualZoo class, the program ensures that the
										user provides a positive integer for the number of animals through a while loop. Within the
										loop, the program prompts the user with the question and attempts to parse the user input as
										an integer using Integer.parseInt(scan.nextLine()).
										a. If the input is a valid integer, it checks whether the entered number is greater than
										zero. If the condition is met, the loop breaks, indicating a successful entry of a
										positive integer. If the input is not a valid integer or the entered number is not
										positive, appropriate error messages are displayed, and the loop continues until a
										valid and positive integer is provided by the user.
										b. This validation process ensures that the program receives a valid and positive number
										of animals from the user.
										
										<p>2. The askAnimalName(int id) class ensures the uniqueness of each animal&#39;s name by utilizing
										a while loop. It prompts the user to input the name for animal #id and checks if the entered
										name is already present in the animalNames ArrayList using
										animalNames.contains(animalName). If a duplicate is detected, the user is prompted to
										provide a different name until a unique one is obtained.</p>
										<p>3. In askAnimalSpecies method I have created custom method called createAnimal in the
										VirtualZoo class, a switch statement is employed to dynamically instantiate an animal object
										based on the user-provided species. The program checks the value of animalSpecies using the
										switch statement and creates an instance of the corresponding animal class (e.g., Tiger,
										Giraffe) accordingly. If the provided species matches a recognized type, the corresponding
										animal object is returned, ensuring a proper and specific instantiation based on the user&#39;s
										input. If the species is not recognized, the program informs the user that it is not a valid
										species, and a null value is returned.</p>
										<p></p>
										<P></P><h3>Task 3 Item Selection</h3>
										
										<P></P>1. I have added one more private attribute called lastGivenItem in the Animal class and added a
										public setter and getter to read and update the last given item for that particular animal. This
										can be checked while giving a new item to that animal. If the given new item is matching with
										the last item then the error message is displayed otherwise, the new item has been given to
										that animal and the lastGivenItem attribute has been updated.
										<p>2. This situation can be handled by adding one more attribute called secondLastGivenItem in the
										Animal class. The new attribute and the lastGivenItem attribute can be used to track the last
										two items given to that animal. If it is increasing more than two last given items, then I can
										add the items given to that animal to a list. Then it can be tracked based on the Zoo
										requirements.</p>
										
										<P><h3>Task 4 Week Cycle</h3>
										<P>1. The use of static for totalCost means it&#39;s associated with the class, not tied to a specific
										instance. This allows the variable to persist throughout the entire program, retaining its value
										even after a method completes. If it were non-static, the variable&#39;s value would be limited to
										the specific method&#39;s execution, getting reset each time the method finishes. So, static here
										ensures a program-wide total cost that lasts as long as the program runs.
										<p>2. Several modifications are needed to enable to manage multiple zoos with separate animals
										and costs.</p>
										<p></p>a. Creating a Zoo class to encapsulate zoo-specific data and functionality. Include
										instance variables like ArrayList&lt;Animal&gt; animals and int totalCost within the Zoo
										class.
										b. Removing the static keyword from totalCost to make it an instance variable. Each
										Zoo instance will have its own totalCost.
										c. Updating methods like askItem, weekCycle and others to operate on a specific Zoo
										instance.
										
										<p><h3>Task 5 Animal Species</h3>
										<p>1. The most direct and intended way to determine the species of an Animal object in the
										provided class hierarchy is by calling the getSpecies() method. While alternative techniques
										like using the instanceof operator or reflection exist, they are generally less direct, less
										encapsulated, and may not align with best practices in object-oriented programming.
										<P></P>2. Making the Animal class an abstract class in the program has several important impacts:
										a. Abstraction : Defines a common blueprint for all animals with shared attributes and
										methods.
										b. Inheritance : Promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses (e.g., Tiger, Giraffe) to
										extend common behavior from the abstract class.
										c. Polymorphism : Enables instances of different animal types to be treated uniformly as
										instances of the common Animal class.
										d. Forcing Implementation : Abstract classes can declare abstract methods, ensuring that
										concrete subclasses provide specific implementations.
									
										<P></P>3. Transforming the Animal class into an interface brings about several changes, including the
										introduction of multiple inheritance, the ability to include default method implementations,
										the absence of fields and constructors, and enhanced flexibility in class implementation when
										contrasted with using an abstract class.
										<P></P>4. The Graphical User Interface can be implemented in another class and the VirtualZoo class
										can be modified to access the data from the GUI and the scanner object inside the VirtualZoo
										
										is no longer needed. So, it can be removed and the corresponding input and parameters for the
										methods can be used from the GUI.</p>

									</p><p><header><h2>Computing Fundamentals</h2></header></p>
									<p><h3>Application</h3>
										<p>To guarantee scalability and manage greater demand during peak hours, ABC Enterprise
										should host its web applications and servers on (EC2). This will ensure that your data is
										available and secure.</p>
										<h3>Models for Cloud Services</h3>
										There are three primary service models for cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a service
										(IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
										IaaS: IaaS offers storage, networks, virtual machines, and other virtualized computer resources
										over the Internet (Hanczewski & Stasiak, 2024). These virtualized resources may execute the
										operating systems and programs the users have installed.
										<p>PaaS: With PaaS, users can create, deploy, and manage apps without worrying about the nitty-
										gritty of the underlying Infrastructure (Isharufe & Jaafar, 2020). This category includes
										databases, middleware, and integrated development environments (IDEs).</p>
										<p>SaaS: Subscription-based SaaS provides access to various applications over the Internet. The
										cloud provider handles everything, from the underlying Infrastructure to the application
										software and data.</p>
										<p><h4>Cloud Deployment Frameworks</h4></p>
										<p>The models used to deliver cloud services outline the steps consumers must take to access these
										services. Here are the four most common deployment models:</p>
										<p>The public cloud: Multiple companies share the same public cloud services, which are offered
										via the public Internet (Deng & Qin, 2020). In the public cloud, may find services provided by
										companies like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.</p>
										<p>Private Cloud: Dedicated to a single enterprise, private cloud services run on a private
										network that may be hosted in-house or by an outside supplier (Dhaya & Kanthavel, 2021).
										Hybrid Cloud: With a hybrid cloud, users are able to access and share resources across both
										public and private clouds (Lei & Wu, 2022).</p>
										<p>Multi-Cloud: To avoid becoming too reliant on any one vendor and make the most of the
										capabilities offered by each platform, multi-cloud uses several distinct cloud services from
										several suppliers.</p>
										<p><h4>Proper ABC Enterprise Models</h4></p>
										<p>The best models to meet ABC Enterprise's needs are: IaaS is the service model.
										Rationale: By using Infrastructure as a Service, ABC can manage and configure its servers,
										storage, and networks with the required control and flexibility.</p>
										
										<p><h3>3.Deployment Model: Public Cloud</h3></p>
										Rationale: An important consideration for ABC, a startup, is the low cost of the public cloud
										architecture. Public clouds, like as AWS, provide excellent scalability and dependability,
										guaranteeing that ABC can manage demand fluctuations without experiencing downtime.
										<p>Problem Statement
										Several serious IT issues ABC Company's expansion and productivity. Startups in particular
										may find it difficult to afford the large initial expenditures required by traditional IT
										infrastructure, which include hardware, software, and physical space. There are performance
										issues during peak hours since this design isn't scalable enough to handle the growing number
										of customers. The lack of thorough disaster recovery plans and redundant systems makes it
										even more difficult to maintain high availability and dependability, leading to frequent
										interruptions and information security issues. Due to its rigidity, the traditional paradigm needs
										continual human involvement to adjust resource allocations in response to unpredictable
										workload fluctuations. All of these problems make it harder for ABC Enterprise to be
										innovative, quick to react to customer needs, and reliable in their service. A more adaptable,
										scalable, and economical IT infrastructure solutions is a need for ABC Enterprise if it wants to
										keep up with the competition and make the most of its resources.</p>
										<p><h4>Steps to Overcome</h4></p>
										To solve their IT problems, ABC Enterprise moved to cloud computing, which drastically cut
										their initial investment. The company could manage higher demand during peak hours by using
										(EC2) for versatile and scalable hosting of web app servers.
										<p>Route53 Pricing for Route 53 on Amazon A DNS web service that is both scalable and very available
										is Route 53. Some important parts of the cost are:</p>
										<p>➢ Prices for hosted zones start at $0.50/month for the first 25 zones and drop to $0.10/zone
										after that (Haque, 2020).</p>
										<p>➢ DNS costs $0.40 per million for the first one billion enquiries, and for every billion
										queries after that, it drops to $0.20.</p>
										<p>➢ Monthly health checks cost $0.50 each.</p>
										<p>Costs of Amazon S3</p>
										<p>➢ Scalable object storage is available with Amazon S3. Aspects of the cost consist of:
										4</p>
										<p>➢ Standard Storage costs $0.023 per GB up to 50 TB per month, while Infrequent Access
										costs $0.0125 per GB</p>
										<p>➢ The cost for each 1,000 requests is $0.005 for PUT, COPY, POST, and LIST
										operations, and $0.0004 for GET operations.</p>
										<p>➢ For data transfers up to 10 TB per month, the cost is $0.09 per GB.</p>
										<p><h3>Elastic Compute Cloud at Amazon</h3></p>
										There are two main pricing structures for the resizable computational capability that EC2
										offers:
										<p></p>➢ Ideal for unexpected workloads, on-demand instances allow to pay by hour or second
										with no long-term obligations (Choudhary A. , 2021).
										<p></p>➢ Save as much as 75% with a one- or three-year commitment; this plan works well for
										workloads that remain relatively constant
										Suitable Cost Model for ABC Enterprise
										<p></p>➢ Route 53: An Appropriate Cost Model for ABC Enterprise Make sure dependability
										and performance are guaranteed by using standard pricing.
										<p></p>➢ Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3): For data that is accessed often, choose Standard
										Storage. For data that has to be accessed infrequently, use Infrequent Access.
										<p></p>➢ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud: To maximize efficiency and minimize expenses, use
										a mix of On-Demand Instances for unpredictable, short-term demands and Reserved
										Instances for more predictable, long-term workloads.
										<p></p>Best Cloud AWS
										Because of its maturity and extensive service offerings, AWS is perfect for innovation and
										adaptability. Azure is ideal for businesses that use Microsoft products since it interfaces with
										them smoothly. Applications that rely heavily on data will find GCP's strengths in machine
										learning and analysis to be an ideal fit.
										<p><h3>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) by Amazon</h3></p>
										<p>Description: Amazon EC2 offers the elastic cloud computing capacity. Users may start
										instances, which are virtual servers, with different combinations of compute, memory, storage,
										and networking capabilities.</p>
										<p><h6>Key Features:</h6></p>
										<p></p>➢ A vast array of instance types are designed for certain use cases, including instances
										optimized for computation, memory, and storage, among others (Choudhary & Verma,
										2021).
										5
										<p>Elasticity is the capacity to autonomously scale up or down using Auto Scaling groups,
										guaranteeing the best possible performance and cost-effectiveness.
										<p></p>➢ On-demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances are some pricing choices that may be used
										to minimize costs according to consumption patterns.
										<p><h3>Application for ABC Company:</h3></p>
										ABC may host their app's web and application servers on Amazon EC2 instances. The
										scalability feature guarantees the service can handle increased demand without interruption at
										peak periods, like a successful marketing campaign.
										<p><h3>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</h3></p>
										Description: Amazon S3 is an object storage solution that can store and retrieve unlimited data
										from any location on the web. It is also very secure and has a long lifespan (Teylo & Brum,
										2020). Regarding AWS services, S3 is well-known for its stability, high availability, and
										integration options.</p>
										<h6>Key Features:</h6>
										<p></p>➢ Data is securely stored and easily available with S3's availability over a year and
										durability.
										<p></p>➢ Automatically handles increasing data loads without sacrificing performance; scalable.
										<p></p>➢ Data management lifecycle rules may be defined, allowing for actions like
										automatically removing objects after a certain time or moving data to alternative storage
										types.
										<p><h3>Application for ABC Company:</h3></p>
										A lot of the static stuff ABC's software needs, such as backups and images, may be stored in
										S3. Durability and availability of the service guarantee that vital data is accessible and secure
										at all times, while lifecycle rules aid in cost management for storage by moving older data to
										less expensive storage classes.
										<p><h3>Implementation</h3></p>
										By moving their operations to the cloud, ABC Enterprise may take advantage of lower initial
										investment, more scalable resources to meet future expansion, and more dependability with
										less downtime.
										<p><h3>Efficient use of resources</h3></p>
										<p>Advantages: The initial expenses of information technology infrastructure may be reduced,
										which is one of the benefits of cloud computing. It is possible that traditional information</p>
										
										<p>6.technology setups need significant expenditures in hardware, software, and facilities, which
										may be prohibitive for startups. There is a usage-based pricing model for cloud services, which
										are pay-as-you-go.</p>
										<p><h4>have the following characteristics:</h4></p>
										<p>• The pay-as-you-go model through pricing allows ABC to pay only for the resources it
										utilizes, eliminating significant up-front costs and boosting the efficiency of its funds
										(Daum & Zhang, 2023).</p>
										<p>• Elasticity guarantees that ABC will only pay for what it needs since resources may be
										dynamically scaled up or down in response to demand, maximizing cost efficiency.
										Scalability and adaptability</p>
										<p><h3>Advantages:</h3> The scalability offered by cloud services is unparalleled, making them an
										indispensable instrument for growing companies. Cloud services are easily scalable, which
										allows them to accommodate ABC's expanding customer base.</p>
										<p><h4>Clouds have the following characteristics:</h4></p>
										<p></p>• Assuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency, elastic computing resources on
										cloud systems such as XYZ Cloud may scale up to meet peak demand and down when
										demand declines. This allows maximum resources to be used (Li & Lu, 2021).
										<p>• The growth of ABC is made possible by auto-scaling, which provides management of
										fluctuating workloads without requiring operator involvement.</p>
										<p><h3>Reliability and abundance of availability</h3></P>
										<p><h3>Advantages:</h3> XYZ Cloud offers cloud services that are trustworthy and accessible, with the
										goal of both minimizing downtime and ensuring that applications are always available.
										<p><h4>Clouds have the following characteristics:</h4></p>
										<p>• Cloud service providers provide high availability by using redundant systems and
										replicating data across several locations with multiple copies (Souza & da Costa, 2020).</p>
										<p>• Cloud providers provide database administration, backup solutions, and disaster
										recovery plans, all of which contribute to increased dependability and reduce the work
										the IT management team at ABC must do.</p>

									<p><h4>Case study on artificial intelligence ethical implications for the future
										signal identification using text mining technique</h4>
										<h4>Introduction</h4>
										<p>The aim of this report is to analyze the ethical implications of artificial intelligence centered
										applications in everyday life such as healthcare, sports, leisure, finance, military, traffic and
										much more. The implementation of new advanced AI technology based big data era, had a
										lot of potential impacts while identifying and predicting future signals. In the upcoming
										studies, the prediction of future signal is significantly an emerging task for the analysis of
										future trends and gaining competitive and future useful insights. The large scale firms such as
										Google, Tesla and IBM produces massive amount of data, this increases the demands of future
										signal identification. Many researchers have proposed aiding text mining process depending
										upon data sources such academic papers and social media and lot more. However, the
										predominant future signal detection is still underneath investigation phase of research area
										and it has a necessity to enhance existing methodology including theoretical framework. The
										current work overviews various studies on determining significant problem due to feeble
										signal prediction approach. This report uncovers revised methodology that includes text
										mining in terms of qualitative and quantitative approach for analyzing the goodness of future
										signal. Furthermore, the report collected text input data from host database analyzed AI
										ethical implications and provided results based on the classification of weak, well-known
										latent and strong signal. This revised technology will be adopted by business stakeholders and
										government to gain insights for the detecting future signals in different areas.</p>
										<p><h4>Background information</h4></p>
										AI application system improves decision making capabilities by extracting, analyzing and
										predicting vast amount of data effectively and efficiently as well as identifies patterns and
										valuable insights that could be neglected by humans. This helps many business organizations
										to achieve more data driven informed decisions and improves operational efficiently and
										reduces errors and eventually fostering better business outcomes (Lee & Park, 2017, p. 653-
										667). Therefore, government sector and companies are increasingly become looking for
										<p></p>3.emerging trends as well as problems that have an ability to frame up their forthcoming
										operational events. This study explores text mining process for determining future signals of
										the particular business sector. The study findings highlights AI and its ethical implications
										while adopting new AI centered technology like text mining for finding future trends and
										signal detection. However, addressing various biases and confirming fairness in the
										implementation of AI technological algorithm is major ethical issue and concern. AI centered
										application system has often used massive amount of sensitive data including customer
										personal identity and banking information. This ethical dilemma has been laid under many
										phases during data collection, data storage and data protection against security and privacy
										breaches and violation (Lei Ma et al., 2018, p. 062188). This report also addresses this issue
										by initiation of possible recommendations of future research area.
										<p><h4>Methods</h4></p>
										Text mining methods are often used in several business managements widely leveraged for
										the transformation process of unstructured text into well-structured style to find meaningful
										insights and new patterns. This text mining technique can analyze vast amount of data
										including qualitative and quantitative textual source material to capture useful and hidden
										values, concepts, patterns and relationship (Krigsholm & Riekkinen, 2019, p. 181). The
										existing methodology is improved by new methodological approach. This new methodology
										based qualitative and quantitative analysis has been implemented in this research for
										forecasting future signals and other events. This methodological approach provides insights
										for both business stakeholders and government. The revised text mining analytical framework
										would be implemented that includes mixed research methodologies such as qualitative and
										quantitative analysis. The required text data will be collected from online publications and
										other data sources like host databases. Using this text data from various sources, the report
										highlights ethical deliberations of AI especially through keyword search option. To analyze
										weak signal, the text mining method will be used from web sources to measure signal as well
										as ethical issues. The keywords frequency is extracted from corpus and classified keywords
										in terms of low frequency as weak signal and high frequency and increase rate as strong signal.
										This methodological approach also incorporates degree of visibility or DoV for demonstrating
										signal and degree of diffusion or DoD for demonstrating issue. In addition, the document
										<p></p>4.frequency DF, total occurrence frequency TF is calculated every year and used for the
										calculation of DoD and DoV. Finally keyword portfolio map is demonstrated with keyword
										emergence map KEM and keyword issue map KIM.
										<p><h4>Results</h4></p>
										This technique plays significant role in many organization and government agencies to easily
										and quickly analyze and comprehend the text and extract meaningful insights using short span
										of time. Many researchers and business analysts have used this technique for analyzing the
										information based on the topic and problem. This technique makes the text easier to read
										because of its visualization features such as charts, graphs and maps etc. It is also possible to
										process complex and multilingual data texts and generate several understandable forms.
										Figure 1: Revised framework for determining future signal
										The above figure shows the output of revised framework that detects the future signal with
										the help of KEM map, KIM map and achieved identification of specific topic and topic
										mapping. As a result, the signal dimension and issue will be measured effectively. Keywords
										are classified by keyword portfolio maps for an effective interpretation of identification of
										future signals estimated by set of keywords. The purpose of the report is to examine those
										keywords derived by each practitioners cluster and ensured that the cluster must be
										identified as a main topic of issue through analyzing actual texts. From this analysis, the strong
										signal and weak signal related to implications of ethical issues incorporated in AI.
										<p><h4>Discussion</h4></p>
										There are several methods has been used as text mining process for finding future signals that
										includes natural language processing or NLP, clustering, content analysis, text categorization,
										information extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis, pattern taxonomy, visualization
										and so on. This type of text mining technology transforms the large data set or text into a
										readable and shorter version. Environmental scanning or horizon scanning is one of the
										traditionally implemented forethought methodologies (Zoccarato et al., 2024, p. 103476). It
										has been widely used to help the management to obtain future events by accessing data from
										external field of environment. The text mining methodology process relatively involves in the
										process of identification of trends, relationship and events from environmental data analysis.
										Finding a weak signal is quite challenging one which is detected by interrupted and unfamiliar
										events. Some procedures are followed for foresight the detection of weak signal. First is
										scanning the signal, assessing the signal, transforming weak signals into problems and finally
										interpreting problems. The revised method considers both quantitative as well as qualitative
										analysis. The predicted future signal has its own three dimensions such as issue, signal and
										interpretation (Ravi Kumar et al., 2020, p. 324-332). The revised method detects future signal
										through AI driven intelligence system using text mining. This report highlights detailed
										definition of each signal type and their contributions in the following research case study.
										Through text mining research method, the strong signal based issue topic regarding AI ethical
										risk such as privacy, human error and safety related keywords are identified effectively.
										Similarly, weak signal based issue topic related keywords are identified regarding AI ethical
										issue from collected data.
										<p><h4>Recommendations</h4></p>
										There are several limitations for the prediction of future research signal and issue. This section
										provides some possible recommendation ways to overcome the problems of current
										methodology to find future signal regarding ethical issues associated in AI technology.
										• It has been recommended to use sophisticated methodology as well as analysis
										<p><h3>Techniques and theoretical approach</h3></p>
										
										• Keyword clustering is a method that has been implemented for accurate signal or issue
										topic selection (Ramzan Talib et al., 2016, p. 414-418).
										• Semantic network analysis helps future study and reveals many hidden values,
										perceptions and phenomena.
										• It is possible to convert weak signal into strong signal by discovering semantic network
										patterns used in clustering keywords.
										• Based on the identification of future signal, the AI ethical issue (Bankins & Formosa,
										2023, p. 725-740) is analyzed effectively which is mitigated effectively through the
										help of risk management, fair and transparent AI system implementation and so on.
										• AI system is reviewed to ensure the ethical standards and to anticipate risks.
										<p> <h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
										The research attempts to determine the future patterns, events and trends from the collected
										massive information that exploits in the emerging big data era. It is very challenging to provide
										methodological approaches to overcome the credibility issue and less accurate prediction
										when processing, accessing and analyzing vast amount of data. In this research, an efficient
										methodological development for finding future signal is effectively demonstrated. For this
										reason, the revised framework is established based on the case study of implications of ethical
										issues while adopting AI system and robotics. This could be enhanced methodology for
										providing analytical capabilities by combing qualitative analysis to the previously
										implemented quantitative analysis. These improved and revised methods can be used to
										evaluate the issue status diffused from ability to emerging problem. In future, this method
										would be applied to both business organizations and government by providing qualitative and
										quantitative analysis and incorporating from latent signal to known future signal.</p>
